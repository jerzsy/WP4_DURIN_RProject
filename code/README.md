Add all code to this folder. Functions should go in a separate folder called Functions.

- **Clean\_WP4\_vegetation\_measurements\_DURIN_data.R** cleans data from the "Vegetation measurements" datasheet, i.e measurements of height, stem length, stem diameter on dwarf-shrubs focal species and height on graminoids and forbs in the control and removal DURIN plots. 

- **Biomass\_weighing\_Analysis.R** quickly processes and analyses the weight measurements on the WP4 biomass plots, for now for Vaccinium vitis-idaea individuals only (from VV replicate plots).
